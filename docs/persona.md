# ðŸ§  `Persona` Object â€“ Key Fields Explained

A persona in mindscope is a structured representation of a specific user, audience, or stakeholder type. It captures their goals, motivations, pain points, and expectations â€” forming the basis for how data is interpreted. Rather than treating all data equally, mindscope asks: What would this persona care about most? This allows the analysis to be more focused, relevant, and actionable. By embedding personas, your insights become context-aware and tailored to real human needs.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `name` (str)

**What it is:**
A short, descriptive name for the persona.

**Example:**

```python
name = "Eco-Conscious Shopper"
```

**Why it matters:**
Gives your persona an identity and makes it easy to reference in reports, visualizations, and logs.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `description` (str)

**What it is:**
A brief paragraph or sentence summarizing who this persona is â€” their role, mindset, and context.

**Example:**

```python

```

**Why it matters:**
Provides human-readable context. Helps clarify the point of view being applied to data analysis.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `goals` (List\[str])

**What it is:**
A list of key objectives or outcomes this persona is trying to achieve.

**Why it matters:**
The engine uses goals to filter and prioritize what data insights are most relevant to the persona.

---

**What it is:**
Challenges, frustrations, or obstacles that commonly affect this persona.

**Example:**

```python
pain_points = ["Greenwashing", "Too much choice", "Lack of transparency"]
```

**Why it matters:**
These help the insight engine detect risk areas, data signals of dissatisfaction, or blockers.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `preferences` (Dict\[str, str])

**What it is:**
Communication and formatting preferences: tone, level of detail, style, or output format.

**Common keys:**

- `tone`: `"trustworthy"`, `"concise"`, `"insightful"`, `"encouraging"`, etc.

**Example:**

```python
preferences = {"tone": "insightful", "detail_level": "medium"}
